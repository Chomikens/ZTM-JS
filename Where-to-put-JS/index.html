    <h1>When async/defer/body</h1>
     <!--  Async-->
    <h2>Async</h2>
    <p>The script with the async attribute is downloaded asynchronously in the background, at the same time as the rest of the HTML page is loaded.</p>
    <p>As soon as the script is downloaded, the browser stops loading the page and executes the script immediately. This means that the script can be executed before the entire page has finished loading, and the exact moment of execution depends on how fast it is downloaded.</p>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>Ideal for scripts that do not depend on other scripts and do not modify the DOM structure. Examples include analytical or advertising scripts.</p>

    <h2>Defer</h2>
    <p>As with async, the script with the defer attribute is retrieved asynchronously, but its retrieval does not affect the page loading process.</p>
    <p>Scripts with the defer attribute are executed only after the HTML page is completely loaded, just before the DOMContentLoaded event. <strong>The scripts are executed in the order in which they appear in the document.</strong></p>
    <h3>Usage:</h3>
    <p>Ideal for scripts that need to interact with the entire DOM tree or when the order of script execution is important.</p>

    <h2>Before closing body tag</h2>
    <p> Placing scripts just before the closing </body> tag is a traditional technique to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before script execution, but it doesn't offer the asynchronous loading benefits of async or defer.</p>
    <p>In modern web development, using async or defer is generally preferred over placing scripts at the end of the body, as they provide better control over script loading and execution without blocking the page rendering.</p>
