# Scope 

There are five kinds of scopes in JavaScript:

- Global scope
- Function scope
- Block scope
- Lexical scope
- Closure scope

## Global scope 
You create a variable in the global scope if you declare the variable outside all functions and curly braces ({}). These variables are called global variables.

```js
const globalVariable = 'some value'
```
